My career started in the arts world, so I am well acquainted with communicating and collaborating with people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds. And it has given me a tremendous amount of empathy for non-technical users. However, the journey from under-employed actor/failing real-estate agent to mid-level web developer did not occur overnight. It all started when...'

					title: 'Fish Out of Water',
					description: 'Fed up with the gypsy lifestyle of a theater atrist, I was working as a rental agent for a real estate broker in Brooklyn. Ony day my boss decided that I should make a website for one of our new properties (though I had made no indications that I was able to do so). Never one to back away from a challenge, I obtained a copy of Dreamweaver and a book on HTML. Within a week we had a perfectly horrible little 4 page site on our hands. Lucky for me, he was satisfied: he paid me a couple hundred dollars and immediately asked for another. This was what those in the world of dramatic literature refer to as the ‘Inciting Incident’.'

					title: 'Freelancing Across America',
					description: 'Once I had a solid grasp on the basics, I decided to bounce around the country for a bit: my travels took me from New York to Minnesota then Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maine, up to Alaska, down to Florida, and eventually back to New York. All the while designing and building WordPress sites for anyone at any price - I didn’t care about anything exept learning new things. I made sites for actors, singers, voiceover artists, a chocolatier, service providers in the fracking industry, a moving company, and a cross-dressing Rabbi. I learned many many lessons during this time but the two main takeaways were: 1. that my design capabilities were limited and 2. that I wanted to learn by working beneath someone more knowledgeable than myself.'

					description: 'Upon returning to New York, I immediately obtained a design internship with <a href="http://www.magnetmediafilms.com">Magnet Media Films</a> - a video production company based in Manhattan. I was able to contribute to a significant amount client deliverables in my 3 months there and learned a ton about design for both print and web. To round out my schedule, I began freelancing with <a href="http://kingfeatures.com">King Features Syndicate</a> - the company which manages the rights to just about every comic strip you might be able to think of. Some of the sites were designed by their team, but I was able to put my new design skills to work and contributed designs to almost half of the fifteen sites I did for them. Some of my favorites include <a href="http://beetlebailey.com">Beetle Bailey</a>, <a href="http://hagarthehorrible.com">Hagar the Horrible</a>, and <a href="http://oliveoyl.com">Olive Oyl</a>.'

					description: 'During my year of travel, I reconnected with a long time friend from college who convinced me to move back to Florida and become her husband. Well...it may not have played out exactly like that, but that‘s a story for a different time. The important detail is that I returned to Florida, married a fantastic girl named Heather, and began working for a full-service creative agency called <a href="https://dppad.com">Different Perspective</a>. My time at Different Perspective gave me experience with multilanguage sites, introduced me to the exciting world of ecommerce, and showed me how to manage relationships with clients. It also taught me that taking the time to compose good documentation is a tiny investment up front that saves hours and hours of emails and consultation down the road.'

I spent the next two and a half years working with two great teams at <a href="https://izea.com">Izea</a> and <a href="http://junyo.com">Junyo</a>. I learned the importance of code standards, the fine art of collaboration via GitHub, and the pain of tech debt. I had the opportunity to work with a great variety of technologies including Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Django, Backbone, Angular, a little bit of Highcharts and a little bit of Node. It was truly inspiring to be surrounded by so many people who were committed to pushing their skills further and doing good work.'

It is also the first time I have worked with proprietary software - instilling within me a profound appreciation for the open source world.'

XAPPmedia specializes in custom voice applications and are on the front lines of pushing the limits of what can be accomplished via conversation. It\'s an absolute pleasure to be involved in what is aligning to be a paradigm shift in how humans issue commands to computers as profound as the touchscreen.'
